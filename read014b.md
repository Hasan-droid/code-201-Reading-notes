## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team .
New research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.
### The article is about Julia Rozovsky story ,
she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life,she worked first in a consulting firm then researcher for two professors at Harvard then she wanted to find a job that was more social so she work in the Yale School of Management.she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds.
study group was a source of stress  becouse People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the team’s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.
Yet many of today’s most valuable firms have co,me to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers, isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.
Five years ago, Google focused on building the perfect team.In 2012 Rozovsky,worked  Project Aristotle by Google looking at how teams worked.
Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams
### Which group would you rather join?
 the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I. Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member
the researchers recruited 699 people divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation.
Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,’
 Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role
 if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There’s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.
And thanks to Project Aristotle, she now had a vocabulary for explaining to herself what she was feeling and why it was important. She had graphs and charts telling her that she shouldn’t just let it go. And so she typed a quick response: ‘‘Nothing like a good ‘Ouch!’ to destroy psych safety in the morning.’’ Her teammate replied: ‘‘Just testing your resilience.’’
‘‘That could have been the wrong thing to say to someone else, but he knew it was exactly what I needed to hear,’’ Rozovsky said. ‘‘With one 30-second interaction, we defused the tension.’’ She wanted to be listened to. She wanted her teammate to be sensitive to what she was feeling. ‘‘And I had research telling me that it was O.K. to follow my gut,’’ she said. ‘‘So that’s what I did. The data helped me feel safe enough to do what I thought was right.’’
