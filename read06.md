## What is an object ?
Objects group  together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something we would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

* In an object  : variables become known as properties and is called property.

* In an object :  functions become known as properties and is called method.

* An object can not have two keys with the same  name.

* The value of a  property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or even another object. The value of a method is always a function.

## Creating an  object
### To create an object , use the new keyword with Object() constructor, like this:const person = new Object(); Now, to add properties to this object, we have to do something like this : person.

### To accessing an Object And Dot notationJavaScript provides two notations for accessing object properties. The first, and most common, is known as dot notation. Under dot notation, a property is accessed by giving the host objectâ€™s name, followed by a period (or dot), followed by the property name.


## the doom 

#### The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.  

##### MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTM L PAGE 

* When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory. The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using.

* When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory. The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using. 

* The DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.

### Selecting an element from a nodelist
There are two ways to select an element from a Nodelis t:
* The item() method and array syntax.
*Both require the index number of the element you want.*


### The item() method :
*Select elements that have a class attribute whose value is hot and store the NodeList in a variable called elements.
Use the length property to check how many elements were found. If 1 or more are found, run the code in the if statement.
Store the first element from the NodeList in a variable called firstItem. (It says 0 because index numbers start at Zero).*
