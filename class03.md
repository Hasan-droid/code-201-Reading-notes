# Lists
## ordered lists
* starts with numbes 1 , 2 , 3
* **syntax**
\<ol> , \<il>
## unordered lists
* uses bullets instead of numbers
* **synatx**
\<ul> , \<li>
## defintion lists
* uses to defintion terms 
* **syntax**

# Boxes
*every html element has a box surround it*
1. *Box Dimensions* : width and height besides max-width , min-width , max-height , min-height , those are useulf for handheld screens
2. *Boreder , margin , padding*:
boreder is invisible box arround the element , where margin sits out side the edge of the border , and paading is the space between the boreder and the content itself
3. *border width , style , color*:styles can be solid , dotted , dashed...etc
4. *centring content*:you need to set the width of the box and then make margin left and right sets auto *you need to specify the docktype to html* to make looks just right
5. *change inline/block display:none preperty will hide the element
6. box visibility: hidden will make ablank space for the element place
# Arrays
*arrays fullfill the needs to creat a list of sameler values*
1.*creating arrays*
 1. literal arrays
 2. constroctor arrays
2. *accessing content of arrays*:
* arrays starts numbering from 0 not 1
* each value needs to its index number before assign new value to it
# conditions and loops
1. *if...else statements*
> * theres no need to provide an else option
> * with a series of if statements, they are all checcked if even match has been found
2. *switch statement*:

 > * You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.
>*  If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements).

**loops**

*loops fullfill the needs to do the code several times*
1. *for* :do the code a specific number of  times
2. *while*:as the condition is true do the code
3. *do while*: do the code at least 1 time even the condition was false
