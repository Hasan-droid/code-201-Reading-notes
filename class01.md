# html5 layouts
**the summary**
> * X The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
different parts of a web page and help to describe 
its structure.
>* The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple <div> elements)
> * Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements
> * To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google
